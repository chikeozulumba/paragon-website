Imagine if the way your company supported its employees was as innovative as the products and services you offer customers. What if HR ditched tedious checklist tasks for an approach as creative as your best brainstorms? Thanks to forward-thinking leaders like Paragon Consulting, who apply design thinking in people operations, that future is already happening.

Instead of reacting to issues, design thinking ventures out to understand employees like never before, then returns with big ideas to test. Its goal? Uncover entirely new ways of building relationships that maximize everyone's talents. And just like your customer research unearths insights that bring growth, its findings inspire new initiatives that foster engagement and fulfillment across the whole organization.

Are you ready to transform how your business champions its greatest assetâ€”its people? Let's explore an evolution in HR and People Ops powered by design thinking's collaborative process.

## What Is Design Thinking?

Design thinking is a collaborative, creativity-based process and mindset that helps businesses solve complex problems in a human-centered way. Design thinking prioritizes understanding user needs above all else. 

According to IDEO, design thinking focuses on the people who are impacted by the problem rather than starting with preconceived notions of the solution. The goal is to gain an empathetic understanding of the users and their needs through techniques like observation and immersion. This helps organizations define the problem from the user's perspective rather than from their own assumptions.

## Benefits of Design Thinking in HR and People Operations

### Employee Experience

So often in business, we get so focused on processes and strategies that we forget the human element. But design thinking flips the script - it's all about seeing things from your people's perspective.

By taking the time to understand what your employees are going through daily, you can gain some valuable insights. What's working well for them in their job? Where are the pain points or frustration that take their energy? Design thinking helps HR zero in on those important human factors.

If you can identify ways to smooth out the bumps for your team members and make their experience more meaningful, it will undoubtedly boost engagement and performance. 

### Innovative Solutions

Once you get to the root of what your people face daily, the creative juices start flowing. Hr and people ops see challenges with fresh eyes, untangled from set ways of doing things. Things that may not have been considered before begin to surface as practical options. And new ideas that could uplift the entire workforce might suddenly come to light. 

### Engagement and Collaboration

You know what they say: two heads are better than one. With design thinking, it's all about collaboration. HR and people ops open their arms to bring different voices together around the table. By giving employees a seat in the discussion, those who do the work can offer their own perspective. Rather than designing for people, it's designing with people. 

### Drives Business Results

When you make your people a top priority like design thinking does, rolling out new solutions becomes a whole different ball game. Because the ideas directly target what matters most to staff, you'll find that those solutions get embraced like nothing before. This enhances business results, as happy, supported employees are proven to be more innovative, loyal, and productive. 

## Phases of Design Thinking

Design thinking follows a general process that typically includes phases for researching user needs, according to the Interaction Design Foundation. However, it is not a strictly linear process. Teams may move between phases in an agile manner to gain better insights as ideas evolve.

### Empathy

The first stop in any design thinking journey is developing pure empathy - it's all about walking a mile in another's shoes. The goal is to gain rich insight into customers' realities and what truly moves them.

The key to this phase is immersing yourself in their world. Get up close through observation and interviews. Hear their authentic experiences in their own words. This helps to understand how they think, feel, and behave in their daily lives and contexts. Design thinkers must also gather both quantitative and qualitative data and put aside preconceptions to truly listen to understand their realities.

### Define

In the define stage, teams compile and synthesize the key insights gathered during user observation and engagement in the empathize stage. The goal is to articulate the core problem or problems that need to be solved in a human-centered way. The teams analyze and organize qualitative user research data like interview transcripts, observation notes, photos, and videos. Then, they identify patterns to understand user behaviors, pain points, unmet needs, and opportunities for improvement.

### Ideate

Now, it's time to get those creative juices flowing. The Ideate stage demands out-of-the-box solutions. Teams must eliminate preconceived notions and look at the defined problem from different perspectives to spark new and creative ideas. The goal of Ideation is to develop as many potential solutions as possible. Examples include brainstorming, brainwriting, analogies, Worst Possible Idea, and SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify/Magnify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse/Rearrange).

### Prototype

Prototyping is the phase where initial ideas are made solid but in the most hands-on, inexpensive way possible. Prototyping brings concepts out of the whiteboard and into the real world. This allows designers to show solutions as concretely as possible. And most importantly, seeing what users really think when they try the prototypes. User feedback is extremely helpful at this stage, as they can readily point out any problems, concerns, or frustrations.

### Test

At this stage, designers rigorously test the complete product or solution using the best ideas and prototypes developed during previous stages. Nothing shows how the product or solution truly performs, like throwing it out there and observing how users interact with it naturally. The goal is to understand at a granular level what's working and where rooms for improvement still lie.

The results of the testing phase are analyzed to determine the next steps - whether to push forward with implementation, continue iterating on the solution based on learnings, or, in some cases, restart the design thinking process from the top.

## The Bottom Line

The future of work is now. To keep up with this pace of change, HR  and people ops can no longer afford to wait and see. They must lead the charge in rethinking how organizations work. Design thinking provides a powerful framework to transform HR and people ops from process overseer to change champion.
